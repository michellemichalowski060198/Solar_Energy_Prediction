# Solar Energy Prediction Project 

## Objective 
The objective of this project is to predict the incoming solar energy of 98 Oklahoma Mesonet sites.

## Renewable Energy Market 
With an increasing trend to use less fossil resources and reduce emissions, the renewable energy industry is naturally gaining
in importance and shows strong eyiciency gains in recent years. Despite all this, energy production is essential for regions
and this is mostly fluctuating in renewable energies, as they are highly dependent on weather conditions. For this reason,
good forecasting models are becoming more and more important and this will also be our final outcome of this analysis. As
already mentioned, we will use exploratory analysis to get a better overview of the data and following that build a model
that will allow us to predict the energy production of diyerent solar stations.

## The Data Set 
The data used in this report is a set of observations obtained from the American Meteorological Society 2013 & 2014 which can
